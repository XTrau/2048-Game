Code editor: MinIDE
Framework: "graphics.h"

The goal of my first coursework was to create the game 2048

### User's guide

When starting the program, the user can skip the screensaver by pressing any keyboard key. In the game menu, the user can select four items. When you select the "Settings" item, a window will open by selecting the dimension of the playing field, the default dimension is four. When you select "About the game", a window opens with brief information about the program and information about the developer. When you select "Exit", the program will shut down. You can start the game by selecting "Play".

At the start of the game, the current number of points and the record for points scored in the selected game mode are displayed above the playing field. The record is downloaded and saved to a text file. The movement of numbers occurs using the arrows on the keyboard. After each move, a number appears at a random position of the field. To win, you need to score 2048 at any position of the playing field. If you win, you can continue the game.

By pressing the ESC key, you can return from any window back to the game menu.
